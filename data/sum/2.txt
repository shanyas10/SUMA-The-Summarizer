Britain can produce 85% of its power via renewable energy by 2030 provided it undergoes significant changes in energy production and use, according to a new study by Greenpeace.
The study attempts to counter the argument that only fossil fuels and nuclear power can keep the lights on for the next few decades.
The plan, which would require a major change in government policies, envisages fossil fuels playing a role via combined gas-fired heat and power projects. 
Many homes and buildings would also need to move away from gas-fired boilers to their own ground source heat pumps or an electricity source.
In 2014, around 30% of UK electricity was generated by coal-fired power plants, 30% by gas, 19% by nuclear and around the same amount by renewables, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
The new analysis shows a low-carbon energy sector is possible but only if our relationship with energy changes at the national, household and personal level.
The cost of the transformation programme is not spelled out, but the Greenpeace report notes that a similar study done in 2011 by Poyry consultants for the parliamentary climate change committee produced a price tag of between £126bn and £227bn to achieve 65% renewable penetration by 2030.
Equally, carbon capture technology – where carbon dioxide is stored underground as soon as it is emitted – has been excluded as it is deemed an unproven method.
