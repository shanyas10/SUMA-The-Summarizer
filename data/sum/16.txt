Refugees hoping to reach the safety of the EU faced a fresh obstacle on Tuesday morning after Croatian police blocked off part of the country’s border with Serbia, which had in recent days become the main entry point to the EU for thousands of people walking north from Greece.
After Hungary shut its southern border a week ago, refugees swerved west through Croatia, and for several days Croatian police let tens of thousands enter through this crossing point.
Sophie-Jane Madden said on Tuesday: “About 8,000 people crossed yesterday from Serbia to Croatia. Only 3,000 can be accommodated in the camp, which leaves many people sleeping outside in the cold [at the border], including women, children and elderly.”
Europe’s leaders are gathering again on Tuesday and Wednesday in another attempt to agree a way of sharing the refugee numbers proportionally among all members of the EU.
Though it has ultimately allowed refugees to continue to cross its territory, Hungary’s parliament on Monday enacted new legislation that grants officials the power to use rubber bullets against refugees, and to search private residences thought to be sheltering undocumented foreigners.
