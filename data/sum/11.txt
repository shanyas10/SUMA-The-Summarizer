A recent Harvard and Stanford Business Schools study (pdf) found that health problems associated with work-related anxiety – including high blood pressure, heart disease and mental illness – account for more deaths each year in the US than Alzheimer’s or diabetes.
“A positive company culture that encourages staff to have enough time for their own lives outside of the office is paramount for any successful business.”
The term workaholic – a portmanteau of “work” and “alcoholic” meaning to work compulsively to the detriment of other interests or commitments – was coined by American psychologist Wayne E Oates in 1968. The advent of modern technology, with its capacity to enslave us to the office 24/7, has arguably made workaholism more prevalent and socially acceptable.
But stringent anti-workaholism policies aren’t the only antidote, cautions Steele. “Often, the highest quality work results when an individual is trusted to take advantage of their independence in a productive way,” she says. “For many small business owners, your working life usually intertwines with your passion so your work is actually fun; therefore I don’t limit working hours but I also don’t track them – for myself or anyone else. My rule is to produce what you’re good at, when you’re good at it. If the client is happy and my team are happy then I’m ecstatic.
There may be no silver bullet to rid the workplace of workaholism, but a cultural shift towards new ways of working might help make it a thing of the past.
