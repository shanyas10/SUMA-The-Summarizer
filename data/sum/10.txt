At least 717 people have been crushed to death in a stampede outside Mecca and more than 850 injured in the deadliest disaster on the annual hajj pilgrimage in a quarter of a century.
Panic broke out when two groups of pilgrims preparing for one of the last major rites of their trip collided at the intersection of two narrow streets. Within minutes the tarmac was a macabre jumble of dishevelled, partially clothed bodies.
The scale of the disaster was so vast that rescue teams worked into the evening to evacuate the injured and bodies of the dead, while security forces kept order among the thousands of pilgrims still filing through the area to finish their rituals.
The tragedy came just weeks after a crane collapse killed more than 100 people and injured more than 200 more in the same area, and two hotels had to evacuate thousands of guests when major fires broke out, also injuring some pilgrims. 
High temperatures and exhaustion among may have contributed to the disaster, military spokesman Maj Gen Mansour al-Turki said, but he added there was no indication authorities are to blame.
The trip is one of the five pillars of Islam â€“ it is a religious duty for able-bodied Muslims to make the journey at least once. Numbers were once limited by the duration and difficulty of a trip to Mecca, but rises in income and cheaper air travel has put thepilgrimage within reach of many more Muslims worldwide.
