They are used to detect criminals evading capture, people trapped in buildings and drugs or explosives hidden in luggage. Now conservationists are recruiting the help of a sniffer dog in an effort to survey – and ultimately protect – wildlife.
The canine will be trained to detect the scent of harvest mice to help better count the elusive small mammal in the British countryside.
Tui, a flat-coated retriever, will be deployed by PhD researcher Emily Howard-Williams to identify harvest mice faeces in a new project to find more effective ways of estimating the population of Britain’s smallest rodent in the wild.
Sniffer dogs have also been used to help scientists locate bumblebee nests – with mixed results, as Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, revealed in A Sting in the Tale. After much expensive training, a former army sniffer dog deployed to detect bumblebee nests was no better than a novice human volunteer in terms of the number of nests he could find in 20 minutes.
