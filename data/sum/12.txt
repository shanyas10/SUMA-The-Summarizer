High-speed internet access via smartphones could become a feature on European airline flights following a deal involving the German carrier Lufthansa – but voice calls will be blocked at first.
Lufthansa will offer Wi-Fi on its short- and medium-haul flights from 2017, provided by the satellite firm Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom.
The companies claim their venture, which combines ground-based mobile broadband networks and the nascent satellite networks already used on some planes, will permit a more reliable, faster connection than passengers currently experience.
Spohr suggested passengers would be able to book flights or order groceries for home delivery after they land – but will probably block Skype-style calls that would disturb neighbouring passengers. The price of using onboard Wi-Fi is likely to be linked to the ticket price and class of travel, with benefits for frequent travellers.
A US government watchdog recently warned that onboard Wi-Fi could enable hackers on commercial flights to bring down the plane.
