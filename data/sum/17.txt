By the time the sun had risen this morning Twitter had run out of pig jokes. Allegations that the British prime minister, David Cameron, “put a private part of his anatomy” into a dead pig while he was a student had broken the internet. #Piggate is trending. Stories about Cameron’s allegedly excessive drug-taking and general debauchery in his youth were even momentarily eclipsed.
Put simply, young people are hard-wired to take risks and do daft things that they may one day regret. There’s really only so much maturity you can expect from someone who is not, in fact, fully mature. The trouble is the consequences for such transgressions vary so massively according to race, sex and class.
When the former president George W Bush was repeatedly questioned on the campaign trail in 1999 about rumours that he had used cocaine and been a heavy drinker as a young man, he responded jokingly: “When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.”
Unlike Bush or Cameron, for many being young and irresponsible is a luxury they cannot afford. “You all keep sending me to jail,” said the Baltimore gang leader Steven Loney after being convicted of racketeering. Coney had a prolific criminal record, including assault with a weapon.
Loney got nine more years. Cameron got to be prime minister.
