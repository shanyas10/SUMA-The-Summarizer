The L’Oreal Foundation have just published the results of a survey they carried out across Europe, asking around 5000 people their views and perceptions of scientists.
Based on the responses recorded in the study, it would seem that overall 67% of Europeans think that women do not possess the required skill set in order to achieve high-level scientific positions (the figure is 64% specifically for the UK).
Meanwhile, in China an absolutely staggering 93% believe that women aren’t cut out to be scientists. When asked for which fields women do possess the right aptitude, 89% of the survey’s respondents said ‘anything but science’, whilst favouring the social sciences, communication and languages as being suitable.
However, 45% of women believed that men blocked women’s progression, and 44% of them (compared with 37% of men) said there was a problem in the support management provided for women.
If the people she talks to in the cinema queue, in the bar or the student union are prone to say ‘really’ when she admits to loving science and aiming high, the drip-drip-drip of negativity is liable to sap self-confidence and aspiration.
Only when gender becomes irrelevant to how people view the person at the bench will equality in the lab even start to be a reality.
