Contradictory accounts have emerged over the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old Palestinian student, Hadeel al-Hashlamon, by Israeli forces at a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron on Tuesday morning, after she allegedly pulled a knife on the soldiers.
Questions over the precise circumstances have been raised by a series of images depicting much of the lethal encounter, including whether a group of heavily armed soldiers wearing body armour acted appropriately in shooting the young woman several times.
According to the Israeli military, Hashlamon was shot after pulling a knife on the soldiers at around 8am at the so-called Container checkpoint near the flashpoint of Shuhada Street in Hebron.
However, Palestinian eyewitnesses and foreign activists from a local group called Youth Against Settlements have contradicted that story.
“She had just come through the metal detector at the checkpoint,” Amro said. “The soldier asked to search her. She didn’t want to be searched by a male soldier and went back to exit from the checkpoint.”
“The attacker attempted to stab a soldier,” an Israeli army spokeswoman told al-Jazeera, explaining that the unidentified soldier – who was not injured – then opened fire.
Another point at which the two accounts diverge is in the claim that Hashlamon was given immediate medical treatment. Instead video that appears to have been taken at the scene shows what seems to be the injured student being pulled roughly by her legs by a soldier from under the barrier where she had fallen.
