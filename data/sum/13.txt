European Union ministers are to meet to try to resolve a dispute over how to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers who have recently arrived in Europe. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants has created deep divisions within the EU.
Migrants, said Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, "are over-running us". "They're not just banging on the door, they're breaking the doors down on top of us. Our borders are under threat. Hungary is under threat and so is the whole of Europe."
Most of those travelling in the Balkans are seeking a route north to Germany and Scandinavia.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for EU leaders to show compassion, saying he was concerned for the situation facing refugees and migrants arriving in Europe.
