Barack Obama’s British cousin is suing the Metropolitan police for £400,000, claiming she was subjected to a campaign of bullying and humiliation.
Marie Auma, of Palmers Green in north London, said officers and employees pursued a conspiracy against her, including two who deliberately broke wind beside her desk at Southwark police station.
Auma, 57, who was at the US president’s inauguration in 2009, claims she was belittled and humiliated by some colleagues when she worked as a civilian in the telephone investigations bureau. She said the campaign against her began when she was refused leave to visit her brothers’ grave after they died in a car crash in Kenya in 2007, resulting in her retirement due to mental health difficulties.
Auma had to take time off work due to chest pains in the second half of 2008, which she put down to anxiety and stress caused by her situation at work. She eventually suffered a mental breakdown and was admitted to hospital, and never returned to work before she retired due to ill health.
