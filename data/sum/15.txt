Vladimir Putin has called Sir Elton John and offered to meet after prank-callers impersonating the Russian president fooled the singer earlier this month.
Putin spoke with John by phone on Thursday and asked forgiveness for the pair of famous Russian hoaxers who had previously called John in his name, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
The tumultuous story of John and Putin began after the singer said in an Instagram post earlier this month that the president had called him and he looked forward to meeting Putin “face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”. John was coming off a trip lobbying for LGBT rights in Ukraine, during which he told the BBC that he wanted to meet with Putin to talk about his “isolating and prejudiced” and “ridiculous” attitude towards gay people.
Despite Putin’s call to John, the president seems to remain firm in stressing “traditional values” over minority rights.
This week, a judge reportedly ordered Deti-404, an online support group for LGBT teenagers, to be shut down, although the site was still accessible on Thursday. This summer, the group’s founder was fined under the gay propaganda law.
